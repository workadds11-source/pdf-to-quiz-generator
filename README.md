# AI SDK PDF Support Example

 HI its MOSAB This example demonstrates how to use the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with the `useObject` hook to submit PDF messages to the AI provider of your choice (Google or Anthropic).


## How to use

Run [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-preview-pdf-support ai-sdk-preview-pdf-support-example
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-preview-pdf-support ai-sdk-preview-pdf-support-example
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-preview-pdf-support ai-sdk-preview-pdf-support-example
```

To run the example locally you need to:

2. Obtain API keys for Google provider.
3. Set the required environment variables as shown in the `.env.example` file, but in a new file called `.env`.
